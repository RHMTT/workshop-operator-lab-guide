Conclusions
=======================

We have reached the end of our journey.  What did you think? You have created several playbooks, containers and created an infrastructure, and deployed it via Ansible Tower.
From here where do you go? Continue to write more playbooks and contribute to the community.  This is just the start of your automation journey.

Call to action
``````````````````
Take what you have created today and build on it.  You now have playbooks in your own Github repository.  You now have containers that you can run, build and modify to suite your
day to day needs.  Contribute to Ansible Galaxy and share the roles that you have created!.
